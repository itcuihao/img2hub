I have developed a Chrome extension that allows users to upload PNG and JPG images found on web pages to GitHub. The extension is designed to streamline the process of saving and sharing images, making it easy for users to quickly upload images to their GitHub repositories without leaving the web page.

With this extension, users can simply right-click on an image and select the "Upload to GitHub" option. The extension will then prompt users to authenticate with their GitHub accounts and select a repository to upload the image to. Once the image is uploaded, users will receive a link to the image that they can share with others.

This extension is ideal for developers and designers who frequently work with images and want a seamless way to save and share their work. By using GitHub as a hosting platform, users can easily manage and organize their images, share them with others, and collaborate on projects.

Overall, this Chrome extension offers a simple and efficient way to upload PNG and JPG images to GitHub, making it a valuable tool for anyone who works with images on a regular basis.
